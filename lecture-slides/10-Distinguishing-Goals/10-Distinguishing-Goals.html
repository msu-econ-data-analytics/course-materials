# Distinguishing goals of data analysis

When we analyze data, what is our ultimate goal?

1. .hi-turquoise[**Description:**] Simply characterize observed patterns in the data.
2. .hi[**Causation:**] Learn about causal relationships: If we change X, how will Y change?
3. .hi-purple[**Prediction:**] Be able to guess the value of one variable from other information.

--

Here are a few quick examples of a research question in each category:

1. .hi-turquoise[**Descriptive:**] Is wealth inequality increasing faster in the U.S. than in Europe?
2. .hi[**Causal:**] Does Medicaid coverage reduce the risk of bankruptcy?
3. .hi-purple[**Predictive:**] Can nighttime satellite imagery be used as a real-time indicator of GDP?

--

Discerning which type of goal you have is critical for:
* **Choosing methods:** Distinct approaches are required to achieve different goals.
* **Interpreting results:** Mistaking one goal for another can lead your audience to make very bad decisions.

# The Data Generating Process

# The Data Generating Process

What's shared across all goals of data analysis:

We start with an **outcome variable** called `\(Y\)`. We want to know some things:
* Where do the values of `\(Y\)` come from?
* How does `\(Y\)` relate to other variables?

The **data generating process** (DGP) in the real world determines the values of `\(Y\)`.
* The true DGP is unknowable, a black box:

&lt;img src="img/black-box-general.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# The Data Generating Process

&lt;img src="img/black-box-general.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We could write this picture as a function:

$$ Y = f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... x_N) $$

But some big questions remain:
- What are all these inputs `\(x_1, x_2, ...\)`?
- What is the functional form? (How does the box work?)

---

# The Data Generating Process

For some questions, the set of inputs and their functional form are discoverable.

**Physics example:** How long does it take for an object to fall from a particular height?

$$ t = \sqrt{2h/g} \approx 0.452 \sqrt{h}  $$

Newton and others did experiments to learn the functional form.

&lt;img src="img/black-box-physics1.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# The Data Generating Process

Even in physics, this is just an approximation to the real world.

&lt;img src="img/black-box-physics2.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The true DGP is more complicated, but it is still limited to a certain number of factors.
* We can understand the vast majority of the "duration of free fall" DGP.

---

# The Data Generating Process

**Social science is harder.** People have free will!
* Inputs? Any outcome is determined by far more than 10 or even 100 inputs.
  - Many inputs are impossible to measure.
* Functional form? No universal laws guaranteeing they are simple.
  - Inputs often interact with each other.

Characterizing the full DGP for *anything* is typically far beyond the realm of possibility.

&lt;img src="img/black-box-general.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

What can we do instead? **Lower our ambitions!**

---

# Types of goals

Most data analysis in economics falls into one of **3 types of goals:**

1. .hi-turquoise[**Descriptive:**] Document or quantify observed relationships between inputs and outputs.
   - Does not not necessarily tell us about the true DGP.
   - Helps us understand facts about the world.
   - Can often inspire questions for further research.

2. .hi[**Causal:**] Try to understand *one piece* of how the box works (the true DGP).
   - When you *change* one factor, how does it change the result?
   - Helps us make decisions about what to do (in policy, business, personal life).

3. .hi-purple[**Predictive:**] Create your own box to try to match the output.
   - Doesn't matter if it works the same, or if you have the correct inputs.
   - Only matters how closely your box produces the same result.
   - Helps us know what's likely to happen in a new situation.

For more clarity, we need to take a slightly technical detour.

# The Potential Outcomes Model

---

# Causation requires counterfactuals

**Causal effect:** the change in one variable resulting from a change in another.
- **Treatment** variable `\(T\)`. (E.g., taking Advil.)
- **Outcome** variable `\(Y\)`. (E.g., severity of pain.)

**Potential outcomes:** What would happen with and without treatment?
- `\(Y^1_i =\)` outcome for person `\(i\)` if `\(T_i = 1\)` (take Advil).
- `\(Y^0_i =\)` outcome for person `\(i\)` if `\(T_i = 0\)` (don't take Advil).

The **treatment effect** for person `\(i\)` is:
`$$\text{Effect}_i = Y^1_i - Y^0_i.$$`

--

**The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference:** Only one potential outcome is ever observable for each person.

`$$Y_{i} =
\begin{cases}
Y_{i}^{1} &amp; \text{if } T_{i}=1\\
Y_{i}^{0} &amp; \text{if } T_{i}=0
\end{cases}$$`
The other one is a **counterfactual** -- what *would* have happened had `\(T_i\)` been different.

---

# Average Treatment Effect

We can never learn the treatment effect by looking at just one person.

Instead, we'll look at many people and try to estimate the **average treatment effect.**

`$$\begin{aligned}
ATE 
&amp;= \mathbb{E}[Y^1_i - Y^0_i] \\
&amp;= \overline{Y^1} - \overline{Y^0}.
\end{aligned}$$`

* `\(\overline{Y^1}\)`: average outcome if everyone had `\(T=1\)`.
* `\(\overline{Y^0}\)`: average outcome if everyone had `\(T=0\)`.

--

But these are still just *potential* outcomes. 😢

&lt;img src="img/potential_outcomes.PNG" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Interpreting mean comparisons

What we *do* have in our data:
- `\(\overline{Y_T}\)`: Average outcome among people who are treated `\((T_i=1)\)`.
- `\(\overline{Y_U}\)`: Average outcome among people who are untreated `\((T_i=0)\)`.

It's often natural to look at the difference in these group means:
`$$\text{Difference in Means} = \overline{Y_T} - \overline{Y_U}$$`

How is this different from the ATE? 
--
**Treated and untreated people aren't the same.**
* Means are taken over groups of people who have different potential outcomes.
- For example: People who take Advil have higher pain than those who don't.
  * Treatment effect is probably negative, but difference in means is positive.

---

# Interpreting mean comparisons

Let's be more precise about the connection between the ATE and the difference in means.

First, we can rewrite these as potential outcomes:
`$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Difference in Means}
&amp;= \overline{Y_T} - \overline{Y_U} \\
&amp;= \overline{Y_T^1} - \overline{Y_U^0}
\end{aligned}$$`

--

Next, I'll use an algebraic trick -- add and subtract the same term:
`$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Difference in Means}
&amp;= \overline{Y_T^1} - \overline{Y_U^0} + 0\\
&amp;= \overline{Y_T^1} - \overline{Y_U^0} + \Big( \overline{Y_T^0} - \overline{Y_T^0} \Big)
\end{aligned}$$`

--

Rearranging, we get:
`$$\text{Difference in Means} = \underbrace{
  \Big(\overline{Y_T^1} - \overline{Y_T^0}\Big)
  }_\text{treatment effect} + \underbrace{
  \Big(\overline{Y_T^0} - \overline{Y_U^0}\Big)
  }_\text{selection bias}$$`

---

# Correlation is causation plus selection

`$$\text{Difference in Means} = \underbrace{
  \Big(\overline{Y_T^1} - \overline{Y_T^0}\Big)
  }_\text{treatment effect} + \underbrace{
  \Big(\overline{Y_T^0} - \overline{Y_U^0}\Big)
  }_\text{selection bias}$$`

The difference in means is a result of 2 processes:
- **Treatment:** The true causal effect of the treatment variable. (Taking Advil reduces pain.)
- **Selection:** Differences in the types of people who are treated. (People who take Advil are in more pain.)

The central challenge of causal inference is to disentangle treatment from selection.

---

# Selection bias

Note:

1. Don't confuse selection bias with sampling bias.
   * **Sampling bias:** We've collected a sample that is unrepresentative of a broader population.
   * **Selection bias:** Within our sample, the people with `\(T=1\)` have different potential outcomes from people with `\(T=0\)`.

--
2. Selection bias is an all-encompassing category for several sources of bias:
   - Omitted variables bias
   - Reverse causality
   - Selection on gains

--
3. To eliminate selection bias and estimate the treatment effect, we need a **research design** a.k.a. **identification strategy.** Examples:
   - Experimentally vary `\(T\)`.
   - Control for enough other variables (eliminate "bad" variation in `\(T\)`).
   - Find an instrumental variable (isolate "good" variation in `\(T\)`).

# Types of goals

Now we can revisit our 3 goals of data analysis.

For sake of illustration, consider a simple linear model:

`$$\begin{aligned}
Y_i
&amp;= f(x_{0i}, x_{1i}, ..., x_{Ni}) \\
&amp;= \beta_0 x_{0i} + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}$$`

All 3 goals are trying to model the DGP, but with different emphases and interpretations.

&lt;br&gt;

Three key differences among the goals:
1. Focus: outcome vs. coefficients.
2. Whether selection bias matters.
3. Interpretation.


---

# Diff 1. Focus: outcome vs. coefficients.

`$$\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i} = f(x_{0i}, x_{1i}, ..., x_{Ni}) = \color{#e64173}{\beta_0} x_{0i} + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \varepsilon_i$$`

.hi-turquoise[**Description:**] Want to estimate a few coefficients: `\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2\)`.
- Focus on showing relationships among a few variables: `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{Y_{i}}}, x_{0i}, x_{1i}, x_{2i}.\)`
- Give up goal of *correctly* modeling the true DGP. Just show patterns as they are.
- Give up goal of understanding all inputs to `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_{i}}\)`.

.hi-purple[**Prediction:**] Want to estimate `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{Y_{i}}}\)`.
- Focus on predicting `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{Y_{i}}}\)` given observed data `\(x_{0i}, x_{1i}, x_{2i}, ....\)`
- Find a model that *works*, by any possible means.
- Give up goal of *correctly* modeling the true DGP.

.hi[**Causal inference:**] Want to estimate one coefficient `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{\beta_0}}\)`, the effect of a treatment variable `\(x_{0i}\)`.
- Give up goal of understanding effects of any other factors `\(x_{1i}, x_{2i}, ....\)`
- Give up goal of explaining the overall level of `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_{i}}\)`.
  - Only how much it changes in response to a change in `\(x_{0i}\)`.

---
# Diff 2. Whether selection bias matters.

`$$\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i} = f(x_{0i}, x_{1i}, ..., x_{Ni}) = \color{#e64173}{\beta_0} x_{0i} + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \varepsilon_i$$`

.hi-turquoise[**Description:**] **No.** Only want to infer patterns from observed data.
- The reasons why patterns exist is an entirely separate question.

.hi-purple[**Prediction:**] **No.** Only want to infer patterns from observed data. Selection gives us valuable information to predict `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i}\)`.
- **Given** that a student attends summer school, what is their GPA?
- **Given** how many people are wearing shorts, will an ice cream truck show up?
- **Given** the size of its police department, how much crime does a city have?

.hi[**Causal inference:**] **Yes.** Want to infer the result of active intervention. Must eliminate selection bias to estimate the treatment effect.
- **If** a student attends summer school, how will their GPA change?
- **If** someone chooses to wear shorts, will it make an ice cream truck show up?
- **If** a city adds more police officers, will crime decrease?

---
# Diff 3. Interpretation.

`$$\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i} = f(x_{0i}, x_{1i}, ..., x_{Ni}) = \color{#e64173}{\beta_0} x_{0i} + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \varepsilon_i$$`

.hi-turquoise[**Description:**] `\(\beta_0\)` represents an **association** between `\(x_{0i}\)` and `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i}\)`.
- It says how the average value of `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i}\)` changes as we look at different values of `\(x_{0i}\)`.
- Only a statement about the data, not about the reasons behind the pattern.

.hi-purple[**Prediction:**] Model does **not** need to be interpretable.
- Coefficients `\(\beta\)` are informative only of predictive power, not causal effects.
- `\(\color{#e64173}{\beta_0}\)` might reflect the treatment effect of `\(X_0\)`, *or* the effects of omitted variables for which `\(X_0\)` happens to be a good proxy.
- Generally, the model can be treated as a black box.

.hi[**Causal inference:**] `\(\color{#e64173}{\beta_0}\)` is a **causal effect** of `\(X_{0i}\)`.
- Under stated assumptions (of the identification strategy).
- Other coefficients generally lack interpretability.

&lt;!-- 1. **Descriptive:** Document or quantify observed relationships between `\(x\)`'s and `\(Y\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!--    - Regardless of whether those relationships arise from treatment or selection. --&gt;

&lt;!-- 2. **Causal.** Estimate how one specific `\(x_0\)` affects `\(Y\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!--    - Find ways to eliminate selection bias and isolate the treatment effect. --&gt;
&lt;!--    - Requires additional assumptions about where the variation comes from. --&gt;

&lt;!-- 3. **Predictive.** Find the most likely value of `\(Y\)` given available data. --&gt;
&lt;!--    - If `\(x_1\)` and `\(Y\)` are correlated, we don't know whether it's causal or selection bias. --&gt;
&lt;!--    - But either way, `\(x_1\)` helps us better predict the value of `\(Y\)`. --&gt;

# Prediction vs. causal inference

When would .hi[causal inference] be useful (to a policymaker, business executive, individual)? When would .hi-purple[prediction] be useful?

1. **Birth weight `\((Y)\)` ~ air pollution `\((x)\)`**

--
   - Causal inference: How strictly should air pollution be regulated?
   - Prediction: What areas might need more prenatal services?

--
1. **Income `\((Y)\)` ~ educational attainment `\((x)\)`**

--
   - Causal inference: Should I go to college? Should we increase investment in public education?
   - Prediction: What types of people should we advertise to? Choose for a tax audit?

--
1. **Probability of default on a loan `\((Y)\)`**

--
   - Causal inference: How can we (borrowers) make better financial decisions?
   - Prediction: Who should we (bankers) lend money to?

--
1. **Poverty `\((Y)\)` ~ public infrastructure `\((x)\)`**

--
   - Causal inference: Can infrastructure investment help fight poverty?
   - Prediction: Which communities need the most aid right now?

# Summary

There are **3 main purposes** of data analysis:
1. .hi-turquoise[**Descriptive analysis:**] Characterize observed patterns among variables.
2. .hi[**Causal inference:**] Learn how Y changes as a result of actively changing X.
3. .hi-purple[**Prediction:**] Predict the value of one variable from other information.

Causal questions require thinking about **counterfactuals.**
* **The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference:** We can only ever observe one of the **potential outcomes.**
* A difference in means gives the **treatment effect** plus **selection bias.**

Key differences among the 3 goals:
1. **Focus:** Prediction focuses on the outcome `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{Y_{i}}}\)`, causal inference on a coefficient `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{\beta_0}}\)`.
2. **Selection bias** is a problem for causal inference, but not predictive or descriptive analysis.
3. **Interpretion:** Coefficients have meaning in causal inference and descriptive analysis, but not in prediction.
