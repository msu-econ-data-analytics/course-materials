# Where data comes from

---

# Where does data come from?

There is a whole spectrum, from DIY to plug-and-chug.

--

**1. Pre-cleaned datasets posted on secondary repositories**
   - E.g. Harvard Dataverse, Kaggle, GitHub.

**2. Open data libraries (e.g., Data.gov)**
   - E.g., [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) or [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/).

**3. Websites of primary data providers**
   - Government agencies; some private companies and NGOs; scientific researchers.

# Where does data come from?

There is a whole spectrum, from DIY to plug-and-chug.

**4. Liberate previously inaccessible data**
   - Build relationships with people in government or the private sector.
   - Find the right person, cold-email them and ask politely.
   - File a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request (a last resort; very aggressive move).

**5. Compile data yourself**
   - Assemble systematic information from many disparate sources.
   - E.g. historical archives, websites, PDF reports.

**6. Collect your own primary data**
   - Run surveys or experiments.

---

# Where to look for data?

**There is no "one-stop shop".** Where to look entirely depends on your topic.

For economics research:

* **Search the literature:** Find papers related to your topic and check the Data section.
  - Good for learning the "standard" sources for common things (e.g., weather data).
* **Find your own data** that the literature hasn't used yet.
  - It's hard to find a novel use for an already widely-used dataset.
* **Combine data in new ways:** Most new projects will require joining data from 2+ sources.
  - E.g. state-level policy changes + household-level outcome data.

A few useful starting points:
- ["How to Find Data: Tips for Finding Data"](https://davidson.libguides.com/data/tips) (Davidson College Library).
- ["Data Sets for Quantitative Research"](https://libraryguides.missouri.edu/datasets/public-use) (University of Missouri Libraries).
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).

# Webscraping

---

# Webscraping

**Webscraping** is just one of many ways to get data.
* Process of converting semi-structured data from the internet to a structured dataset.
* Useful when information is already online, but not available in a nice CSV file.

Webpages are largely made out of HTML and CSS files that we have to parse.

* **HTML** is a markup language, like R Markdown. It specifies the structure of a webpage.

* **CSS** is language for formatting the appearance of a webpage.

  - CSS **properties** specify *how* to format: what font, what color, how wide.

  - CSS **selectors** specify *what* to format: what structural elements get what rule.

# Application: Women's 100-meter sprint

**Application:** Wikipedia table of world records in the [women's 100-meter sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression).

* Right-click and go to **View page source** to see the underlying HTML.

* Try to find the first table of records and see how it's coded in HTML.

--

Let's scrape this table with `rvest`.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

First, read the whole page into R:

```r
url = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression"
page = read_html(url)
page
```

```
## {html_document}
## &lt;html class="client-nojs" lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;
## [1] &lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...
## [2] &lt;body class="mediawiki ltr sitedir-ltr mw-hide-empty-elt ns-0 ns-subject  ...
```

---

# Application: Women's 100-meter sprint

**Method 1:** Navigate a list of tables.

Get a list of HTML tables in this page:

```r
tables = page |&gt; html_elements("table")
tables
```

```
## {xml_nodeset (11)}
##  [1] &lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor="#D6ECF3"&gt;ratified\n&lt;/ ...
##  [2] &lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Wind\n&lt;/th&gt; ...
##  [3] &lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Wind\n&lt;/th&gt; ...
##  [4] &lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Wind\n&lt;/th&gt; ...
##  [5] &lt;table class="nowraplinks mw-collapsible autocollapse navbox-inner" styl ...
##  [6] &lt;table class="nowraplinks navbox-subgroup" style="border-spacing:0"&gt;&lt;tbo ...
##  [7] &lt;table class="nowraplinks hlist mw-collapsible autocollapse navbox-inner ...
##  [8] &lt;table class="nowraplinks navbox-subgroup" style="border-spacing:0"&gt;&lt;tbo ...
##  [9] &lt;table class="nowraplinks navbox-subgroup" style="border-spacing:0"&gt;&lt;tbo ...
## [10] &lt;table class="nowraplinks mw-collapsible mw-collapsed navbox-inner" styl ...
## [11] &lt;table class="nowraplinks navbox-subgroup" style="border-spacing:0"&gt;&lt;tbo ...
```

```r
length(tables)
```

```
## [1] 11
```

# Application: Women's 100-meter sprint

Convert the second table to a data frame:

```r
records = tables[[2]] |&gt; html_table()
records
```

```
## # A tibble: 55 × 7

# Application: Women's 100-meter sprint

**Method 2:** Identify CSS selectors via your browser's "inspect web element".
1. Right click -&gt; Inspect.
2. Mouse over the list of elements until the table you want is selected.
3. Right click -&gt; Copy -&gt; Copy selector.

```r
selector = "#mw-content-text &gt; div.mw-parser-output &gt; table:nth-child(8) &gt; tbody"
records2 = page |&gt; 
  html_elements(selector) |&gt;
  html_table()
records2
```

# Challenge

**Scrape the Wikipedia page of world records in the *men's* 100 meter sprint.**
* Get all 3 main tables:
  1. Unofficial before IAAF
  2. Records 1912-1976
  3. Since 1977
* Append them with `bind_rows`.
* Be careful: What happens when cells are merged in the original table?
* Do enough cleaning to make it useful for analysis. A few tips:
  * Simplify column names with `janitor::clean_names`.
  * Convert dates to date format with `lubridate::mdy`.
  * Separate location into city and country with `tidyr::separate`.
  * Combine columns when names are inconsistent.
  * Discard columns that lack useful information or aren't available in all 3 tables.
* Make a graph of the progression of the world record over time.


---

# More advanced webscraping

Not all information is so lucky as to be encoded in a nice HTML table.

* `rvest` has much more functionality to handle complex situations.

* Start with `vignette("rvest")`. (Most packages have a helpful vignette!)

* If you start doing a lot of webscraping, you'll want to learn more about HTML and CSS.


---

# Webscraping many pages

The benefits of webscraping become clear with more than one table.
* With one table, you could just copy and paste into Excel and save as a .csv.
* But what if you want data on all world records in track &amp; field?

**Scrape multiple pages** by combining webscraping with programming tools
* For loops, `lapply`, `purrr:map`.
* Find links and follow them programmatically.

**Caution:** scraping many pages can easily overwhelm web servers.
* This is not nice, plus you might get blocked.

**Solution:** Follow a few guidelines.
* Seek permission before scraping (check the robots.txt).
* Take slowly (pause a few seconds between requests).
* Never ask twice (download once, not every time you run a script).
* The `polite` package helps you do these things.

# Using APIs

# APIs

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allow different pieces of software to communicate with each other. Some key concepts:

* **Server:** A powerful computer that runs an API.
* **Client:** A program that exchanges data with a server through an API.
* **Protocol:** The "etiquette" underlying how computers talk to each other (e.g. HTTP).
* **Methods:** The "verbs" that clients use to talk with a server.
  - The main one that we’ll be using is GET (i.e. ask a server to retrieve information).
  - Other common methods are POST, PUT and DELETE.
* **Request:** What the client asks of the server (see Methods above).
* **Response:** The server’s response. This includes:
  - Status Code (e.g. “404” if not found, or “200” if successful).
  - Header (i.e. meta-information about the response).
  - Body (i.e. the actual content that we’re interested in).

# FRED

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis maintains an incredible database for macroeconomic statistics and data called **FRED.**
* You can create graphs on the FRED website and download CSV data.
* It also helpfully provides an API so that you can load data directly into R.

To use most APIs, you need to obtain an **API key.** A key identifies yourself to the API.

**Treat your API key like a password. Keep it secure and don't share it with others.**
* You're responsible for following the API's terms &amp; conditions, and you can't control that if you share your key.

**Take a minute to [register for a free account](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikey) and [request an API key.](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikey)**

---

# Setting environment variables

Don't hard-code your API key in a script, since you might share your script. Instead, define an **environment variable.**

Run this line **IN YOUR CONSOLE** to define an environment variable for the current R session (replacing the fake string with the one you got from the FRED website):

```r
Sys.setenv(FRED_API_KEY = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789")
```

You can use an environment variable within a script like this:

```r
Sys.getenv("FRED_API_KEY")
```

---

# Using the FRED API

To learn how to use this API, start with the [FRED API documentation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/). You'll see:
* There are many types of requests you can make of FRED using the API.
* If you want the underlying data for a data series, we want to go to **fred/series/observations**.

Clicking the link brings you to the [specific documentation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html) for this request. We can see:
* The API can return data in several different **file formats.**
* The exact **syntax** for making a request (for each format).
* The **parameters** that you can provide (like function arguments).

---

# Using the FRED API

One required parameter is `series_id`.
* Let's look at the median home listing price in Bozeman.
* By searching the FRED website, I found that the ID for this series is `MEDLISPRI14580`.

For the `file_type`, you can use either XML or JSON.
* Both are ways to precisely structure information and can easily be read into R.
* Let's use **JSON** for this example.

**Try out the API right in your browser.** Paste this into your location bar, replacing the fake API key with your own:
`https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=MEDLISPRI14580&amp;api_key=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456&amp;file_type=json`

---

# Using the FRED API

To use the API in R, we'll use the tidyverse package `httr`. Load it, then define some variables with the information we need:

```r
library(httr)
url = "https://api.stlouisfed.org/"
endpoint = "fred/series/observations"
params = list(api_key = Sys.getenv("FRED_API_KEY"),
              file_type = "json", 
              series_id = "MEDLISPRI14580")
```

Now we can use the `GET` method to request data from the server:

```r
response = httr::GET(url = url, path = endpoint, query = params)
response
```
```
Response [https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?api_key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
&amp;file_type=json&amp;series_id=MEDLISPRI14580]
  Date: 2022-09-27 00:39
  Status: 200
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
  Size: 7.61 kB
```

---

# Using the FRED API

The response is a complex list object. Extract the JSON content, and convert it to an R object:

```r
library(jsonlite)
json = response |&gt;
  httr::content("text") |&gt;
  jsonlite::fromJSON()
```

If you `View` this object you'll find that what we really want is `json$observations`.

```r
bzn_house_prices = as_tibble(json$observations)
bzn_house_prices
```

```

---

# Challenge

**How has Bozeman's pandemic housing market compared with other cities?**
* Get similar data from 2-3 other housing markets you're interested in.
* Plot time-series graphs for each housing market.
* More advanced:
  - Write a function to retrieve each series.
  - Combine all the results in 1 dataframe (keep it tidy!).


---

# Hidden APIs

Sometimes, you can find an open but "hidden" API that a webpage is using to render data.
* For example, Airbnb uses or has used a hidden API to display search results on its web interface.
* Grant McDermott has an [example](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/07-web-apis/07-web-apis.html#Application_3:_World_rugby_rankings) of how to find and use hidden APIs.

**Using hidden APIs may present legal risks, so I don't recommend it.**
* In April 2022 (*HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn*), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that webscraping is legal in the U.S. so long as the data is publicly available.
* Do hidden APIs constitute publicly available information? It's not totally clear.

Even if generally legal, webscraping may be a violation of websites' Terms &amp; Conditions.
* Airbnb's: "Do not use bots, crawlers, scrapers, or other automated means to access or collect data or other content from or otherwise interact with the Airbnb Platform."
* Your account could be blocked/blacklisted.

# Some APIs that are free &amp; legal

Some fun APIs:
* [TikTok (unofficial)](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api)
* [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)
* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
* [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

This list of [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) has many more.

Many **R packages** have been built to make working with APIs easier. Some examples:
* `tidycensus` for American Community Survey microdata and other Census Bureau data.
* `Quandl` for Nasdaq and other financial information.
* `rtweet` for Twitter data.
* `rnoaa` for NOAA weather data.
* `rnassqs` for USDA's QuickStats API (agricultural data).
* `osmdata` for OpenStreetMap spatial data.
