# Setup: Credit card default data

---
name: setup
class: inverse, middle

---

**1.** Load some libraries:

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, skimr, janitor, tidymodels, magrittr, tune,
       glmnet, readxl, kknn, rpart.plot)
```

And this data on credit card defaults:

```{r}
default = 
  # skip the first row to load the correct variable names
  read_excel("data/default of credit card clients.xls", skip=1) %>%
  # clean variable names with janitor::clean_names()
  clean_names()
```

---

.scroll-output-full[
```{r}
skim(default)
```
]

---

**2.** Convert categorical variables to factors (because `tidymodels` isn't so great for this step)

.scroll-output-75[
```{r}
default2 = default %>%
  mutate(across(sex:marriage | pay_0:pay_6 | default_payment_next_month,
                as_factor))
skim(default2)
```
]

---

**3.** Split the sample into training (80%) and test (20%).

```{r}
set.seed(101)
default_split = default2 %>% initial_split(prop = 0.8)
default_train = default_split %>% training()
default_test  = default_split %>% testing()
```

**4.** Define a recipe. We'll be predicting whether each customer defaults on their credit card payment in the following month.

```{r}
default_recipe = default_train %>% 
  recipe(default_payment_next_month ~ .) %>%
  update_role(id, new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors())
default_clean = default_recipe %>% prep() %>% juice()
```

class: inverse, middle
# Logistic regression and KNN

---
layout: true
# Logistic regression example

---

Fit a simple logistic regression:

```{r}
# Define a simple logistic model
model_logistic = logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm")

# Define the workflow
workflow_logistic = workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(default_recipe) %>%
  add_model(model_logistic)

# Fit the model in the training set, make predictions in the test set
predict_logistic = workflow_logistic %>%
  fit(data = default_train) %>%
  augment(new_data = default_test)
```

---

View the results:

```{r}
head(predict_logistic %>% select(default_payment_next_month | starts_with(".")), 10)
```

---

Calculate accuracy and the confusion matrix:

```{r}
accuracy(predict_logistic, 
         truth = default_payment_next_month, 
         estimate = .pred_class)
conf_mat(predict_logistic, 
         truth = default_payment_next_month, 
         estimate = .pred_class)
```

---
layout: false
# KNN example

Fit a k-nearest neighbors model instead (choosing $k=10$):

```{r}
# Define a simple KNN model
model_knn = nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 10, mode = "classification") %>%
  set_engine("kknn", scale = TRUE)

# Define the workflow
workflow_knn = workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(default_recipe) %>%
  add_model(model_knn)

# Fit the model in the training set, make predictions in the test set
predict_knn = workflow_knn %>%
  fit(data = default_train) %>%
  augment(new_data = default_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy(predict_knn, truth = default_payment_next_month, estimate = .pred_class)
```

---
# Tuning K in KNN

We can optimize *k*-nearest neighbors by tuning the value of $k=$ `neighbors` through cross-validation.

Note you can use KNN for regression too - just switch to `mode = "regression"`.


---
layout: false
name: cv
class: inverse, middle
# Cross-validation

---
layout: true
# Logistic regression + shrinkage

---

We can add regularization to a logistic regression in almost exactly the same way as a linear regression.

```{r}
# Create a 5-fold cross-validation split
default_cv = default_train %>% vfold_cv(v = 5)

# Define a logistic model with ridge regularization
model_logridge = logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 0) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

# Define the workflow
workflow_logridge = workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(default_recipe) %>%
  add_model(model_logridge)

# Define a sequence of lambdas to try
lambdas = 10 ^ seq(from = 4, to = -2, length = 50)
```

---

The difference is that we have to specify a metric appropriate to classification (i.e., `accuracy` instead of `rmse`).
- You could also specify `sensitivity`, `specificity`, or `precision`.
```{r}
# Cross-validate
cv_logridge = workflow_logridge %>% tune_grid(
    default_cv,
    grid = data.frame(penalty = lambdas),
    metrics = metric_set(accuracy)
  )

# Show the best model
cv_logridge %>% show_best(n=3)
```

---

.small[
```{r}
# Fit the best model in the training set, make predictions in the test set
predict_logridge = workflow_logridge %>%
  finalize_workflow(select_best(cv_logridge, 'accuracy')) %>%
  last_fit(default_split) %>%
  collect_predictions()

# Calculate accuracy and the confusion matrix
accuracy(predict_logridge, 
         truth = default_payment_next_month, estimate = .pred_class)
conf_mat(predict_logridge, 
         truth = default_payment_next_month, estimate = .pred_class)
```
]


---
layout: true
# Decision trees

---
name: trees
class: inverse, middle

---

Fit a decision tree (give it the raw data, not the normalized or dummy variables):

```{r}
# Define a decision tree model
model_tree = decision_tree(mode = "classification", cost_complexity = 0.003) %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

# Define the workflow & fit the model
fit_tree = workflow() %>%
  add_formula(default_payment_next_month ~ .) %>%
  add_model(model_tree) %>%
  fit(data = default_train)
```

---

.small[
Output:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
fit_tree
```
]

---

Visualize the tree:

```{r, out.width="90%"}
rpart.plot(extract_fit_engine(fit_tree))
```

layout: false
# Tuning (and pruning) the tree

Decision trees have several possible tuning parameters:
- `cost_complexity`
- `tree_depth`
- `min_n`

You can read more about them in the R documentation, [ISLR](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) chapter 8, or by Googling (try [here](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/tuning/), [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/tree-based-methods.html), or [here](https://juliasilge.com/blog/wind-turbine/)).

Believe it or not, we've already gotten far enough with machine learning that you can now teach your computer how to read.

The **MNIST database** is a set of images of handwritten numerical digits. They look like this:

```{r, echo=F, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/digit-images-example-1.png")
```

- The images are scanned, centered, and represented in $28 \times 28=784$ pixels.
- Each pixel's value is a grayscale intensity between 0 (white) and 255 (black).
- Each image has also been read by a human and identified as a digit (0-9).
]

---

**1. Load the data** and take a subset (for quicker computation):

```{r, cache=T}
p_load(dslabs)
mnist = read_mnist()
set.seed(1990)
index = sample(nrow(mnist$train$images), 10000)
x = mnist$train$images[index,]
y = factor(mnist$train$labels[index])
numbers = bind_cols("y"=y, as_tibble(x))
```

---

**2. Split the sample** and take a look at the data:

```{r, cache=T}
numbers_split = numbers %>% initial_split(prop = 0.8)
numbers_train = numbers_split %>% training()
numbers_test  = numbers_split %>% testing()
head(numbers_test, 8)
```

---

**3. Set up a recipe** & remove near-zero-variance predictors:

```{r, cache=T}
numbers_recipe = numbers_train %>%
  recipe(y ~ .) %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors())
numbers_clean = numbers_recipe %>% prep() %>% juice()
head(numbers_clean, 8)
```

---

**4. Fit a KNN model,** k=10 (this will take a minute or so):

```{r, cache=T}
# Define the model
numbers_model = nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 10, mode = "classification") %>%
  set_engine("kknn", scale = TRUE)

# Fit the model
numbers_workflow = workflow() %>%
  add_model(numbers_model) %>%
  add_recipe(numbers_recipe) %>%
  fit(numbers_train)

# Predict in the test set
test_predictions = numbers_workflow %>% 
  last_fit(numbers_split) %>% 
  collect_predictions()
```

---

**Take a look at the results!**

```{r, eval=F}
head(test_predictions)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
test_predictions %>% 
  dplyr::select(.pred_4:.pred_9 | .pred_class | y) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) %>%
  slice_head(n=100) %>% slice_tail(n=86) %>%
  datatable(options = list(dom = 't'))
```

---

**Confusion matrix:**

```{r}
conf_mat(test_predictions, truth=y, estimate=.pred_class)
```

---

**Overall accuracy:**

```{r}
accuracy(test_predictions, truth=y, estimate=.pred_class)
```

---

Let's calculate accuracy metrics by digit...

```{r, cache=T}
pred_numbers = test_predictions %>%
  dplyr::select(y_hat = .pred_class, y) %>%
  mutate(correct = 1*(y==y_hat))
sens = pred_numbers %>%
  group_by(y) %>%
  summarize(sensitivity = mean(correct))
prec = pred_numbers %>%
  group_by(y_hat) %>%
  summarize(precision = mean(correct))
by_class = bind_cols(sens, prec) %>% dplyr::select(-y_hat)
```

---

**Sensitivity and precision by digit:**

```{r}
by_class
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Unused code to plot results by class
# summary_numbers %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols=sensitivity:precision) %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x=y, y=value, color=name)) +
#     geom_line() +
#     geom_point(size=3) +
#     facet_grid(. ~ name)
```

---

Our error rate was **4.2%.**

* [Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) have gotten as low as **0.52%** with KNN.

* And as low as **0.17%** with convolutional neural networks.
