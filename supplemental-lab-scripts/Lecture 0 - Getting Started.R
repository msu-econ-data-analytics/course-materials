#Type the number '2' and then the word 'two'

2

two

#Notice that the '2' is blue and 'two' is not.

#With your cursor on the same line as '2' go ctrl + enter to run the line of code.
#When you run the line of code with the number '2' it prints 2 in the console. When
#you run the word 'two' R does not recognize it as an object.


#Type and run the following:

1+4

6-3

4/5

10*3.4

#The console should print out the code above in blue and the answer in black. R can
#function as a normal calculator but it can be finicky about how you type things.

#Try the following:

4(5)

#R does not recognize () as multiplicative. '*' must be used. '()' can be used normally
#otherwise.

4*5

4*(3-2)
